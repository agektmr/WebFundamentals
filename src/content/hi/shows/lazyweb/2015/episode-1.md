### React Native <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">0:13</span>

React Native is an open source framework which allows you to run your react app on native iOS. It comes with a bundle of components and you can grab additional add-ons at [react.parts/native-ios](http://react.parts/native-ios).

Learn more in [this video from React.js Conf](https://youtu.be/KVZ-P-ZI6W4).

### A11y-Wins <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">0:31</span>

It's hard to find good examples of accessibility websites. To help solve this problem Marcy Sutton has created [a11ywins.tumblr.com](http://a11ywins.tumblr.com/) which covers sites which are doing accessibility right.

Learn more on accessibility by [watching Marcy Sutton's talk from Smashing Conf](https://vimeo.com/118697675).

### Polymer 0.8 <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">0:48</span>

Polymer 0.8 is out in the open and showing great performance boosts with 5x improvement on mobile safari and 8x improvement on desktop Firefox.

![Graph show 5x improvement on mobile Safari and 8x improvement on desktop Firefox](./images/episode-1-benchmark.svg)

Checkout the [blog post on the release here](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.8/) and [learn more in this Polycast](/web/shows/polycasts/season-2/first-look-polymer-0.8).

### Preload Links <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">1:05</span>

Downloading resources can be a major bottleneck and preload links are a new way to give the browser prioritization over what assets to download ahead of time.

With this [intent to implement](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/Abrd-tbDyuQ/4YP6_yvBa94J), signals are good that it'll be coming to Chrome.

### Project Spartan <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">1:21</span>

Project Spartan is Microsoft's new browser built to be lean, mean and standards compliant. [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/31/8319169/project-spartan-new-browser-microsoft-hands-on) took for a test drive and you can [learn more from either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKjkfkAmzAg) of [these videos from Microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A5ZXWTIlHw).

Still want more? Then no worries, you can check out the [Technical Preview of Spartan here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/03/30/quot-project-spartan-quot-in-the-windows-technical-preview-build-10049.aspx).

### Physical Web Beacons <span class="lazyweb-title-timestamp">1:42</span>

The [Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/) was a project started at Google which uses beacons to transmit signals which are picked up by mobile devices to know what is around them.

Blesh have just released a demo of [their physical web beacons which you can watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AryiXsPQ1Y).
